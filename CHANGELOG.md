# Changelog

## Unreleased

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- Removed the `plex` STRM export style. Existing STRM outputs configured with `style: plex` must switch to `kodi`,
  `emby`, or `jellyfin`; Plex use cases should use the HDHomeRun integration instead. Existing generated TMDB marker
  paths remain read-compatible, but `style: plex` is no longer accepted in configuration.

## 🌟 New Features

- **Trakt Charts**: Xtream Trakt integration can now build virtual categories from public Trakt charts via `trakt.charts[]`.
  - MVP supports `movies/shows` with `trending` and `popular`.
  - User-owned Trakt lists remain configured separately under `trakt.lists[]`.
- **Per-User Output Clusters**: API proxy users can now be restricted to specific clusters on their assigned target via
  `output_clusters`.
  - Supported values: `live`, `vod`, `series`.
  - The filter is evaluated per user and limits which clusters are visible and deliverable for that account.
  - At least one cluster should be selected if you want an active restriction.
  - If no cluster is selected, the filter is treated as inactive and Tuliprox serves all clusters for that user.
- **Input Resolve Filter**: Added `resolve_filter` option to input configuration to selectively resolve only entries matching a filter expression.
- **Input Probe Filter**: Added `probe_filter` option to input configuration to selectively probe only entries matching a filter expression.
- **Soft Connections And Soft Priority**: API users can now be configured with `soft_connections` and `soft_priority`.
  - Soft connections allow a user to consume additional preemptible provider slots above `max_connections`.
  - `soft_priority` is only applied while a connection is using a soft slot; once a regular slot becomes available again, the running connection  
    is promoted back to `Normal` and uses the user's normal `priority`.
  - The soft-vs-normal classification is now preserved through provider-backed stream creation, HLS session handling, and shared live-stream reuse.
  - The Web UI user editor now exposes both soft connection count and soft priority.
  - The user DB schema is upgraded accordingly to persist the new fields.
- **Download And Recording Manager**: The Web UI download feature has been expanded into a provider-aware download/recording manager.
  - VOD, series and episode downloads now use typed transfer snapshots across REST and websocket updates.
  - Download state in the Web UI is websocket-driven after the initial snapshot instead of relying on repeated REST polling.
  - Live entries can be scheduled as recordings through an `ffmpeg`-based recording worker.
  - Download and recording tasks now respect provider capacity and join the normal priority/preemption model instead of bypassing provider limits.
  - Download snapshots and actions are integrated into RBAC through the dedicated `download.read` and `download.write` permissions.
  - Background fairness controls were added under `video.download`:
    - `reserve_slots_for_users`
    - `max_background_per_provider`
    - `download_priority`
    - `recording_priority`
  - Transient retries now use exponential backoff with jitter and an explicit retry ceiling via:
    - `retry_backoff_initial_secs`
    - `retry_backoff_multiplier`
    - `retry_backoff_max_secs`
    - `retry_backoff_jitter_percent`
    - `retry_max_attempts`
  - Transfer snapshots now expose `WaitingForCapacity`, `RetryWaiting`, `retry_attempts` and `next_retry_at`.
  - Waiting transfers stay cancelable/pausable while they are blocked on provider capacity or retry backoff.
  - The download scheduler and active worker now participate in config hot reloads and restart under updated `video.download` settings.
  - Corrupted persisted download state is renamed to a timestamped `*_corrupt.*.json` backup and no longer blocks server startup.
  - Playlist Explorer download and recording actions are hidden without `download.write`, and duplicate queue requests now return the existing  
    task instead of creating a second entry.
  - The Playlist Explorer now supports:
    - optional priority override for VOD/series/episode downloads
    - start time, duration and optional priority override for live recordings
  - Missed scheduled recordings are now terminalized during recovery/promotion instead of being replayed late.
  - Preempted or retried live recordings continue with the remaining recording window instead of restarting with the full original duration.
- **QoS Aggregation Persistence**: Added a new persisted QoS snapshot repository (`qos_snapshot.db` + `qos_snapshot_meta.db`) in the storage directory.
  These files are maintained automatically by the QoS aggregation worker and become part of the local persistent runtime state.
- **Stream History QoS Foundation**: Stream history now captures structured QoS-relevant stream lifecycle data for later  
  reliability analysis and failover preparation.
  - Added `connect_failed` as a first-class event type for startup failures before a stable session exists.
  - Added structured `failure_stage` classification (`admission`, `provider_open`, `first_byte`, `streaming`, `session_reconnect`).
  - Added `connect_failure_reason` for startup/admission failures such as exhausted user/provider capacity.
  - Added structured provider failure metadata via `provider_error_class` and `provider_http_status`.
  - Added stable stream identity fields for cross-run QoS aggregation:
    - `input_name`
    - `stream_identity_key`
    - `stream_url_hash`
  - Added shared-stream QoS markers:
    - `shared_joined_existing`
    - `shared_stream_id`
  - Stream disconnect history now stores meaningful `disconnect_reason` values:
    - `provider_error`
    - `provider_closed`
    - `preempted`
    - `session_expired`
    - `client_closed`
- **Connect Failure Recording**: Admission and provider-open failure paths now write `connect_failed` records into stream  
  history instead of only surfacing fallback responses.
  This includes exhausted user/provider capacity and provider-open/channel-unavailable style startup failures.
- **QoS Snapshot Aggregator**: Added a periodic QoS aggregation worker that reads stream history partitions and persists  
  compact QoS snapshots per stream identity.
  - Uses a dedicated B+Tree snapshot repository.
  - Maintains rolling `24h`, `7d`, and `30d` windows from daily buckets.
  - Runs outside the streaming hotpath and processes history incrementally in the background.
- **QoS Snapshot Tooling**:
  - Added `--dbq` to inspect the QoS snapshot database from the CLI DB viewer.
  - Added backend QoS snapshot read endpoints for summary/detail access.
  - QoS snapshot API supports both JSON and CBOR responses depending on the request `Accept` header.
  - The Web UI now shows QoS summary/detail data alongside stream history and requests QoS data via CBOR.
- **QoS Configuration**: Added a dedicated `reverse_proxy.qos_aggregation` configuration block to control the periodic aggregator.
- HLS session expiry now emits a disconnect history record with reason `session_expired`.
- A minimal stdout logger is now initialized at the very start of the process so that
  errors during path resolution and early startup are always visible in the console.
- **Stream History Writer Block Bounds**: Stream-history block headers now use the real min/max event timestamps of the  
  batch instead of assuming the first/last batch element is time-sorted.
- **CLI Viewer Testability**: The stream-history viewer no longer calls `process::exit()` internally; exit handling now  
  happens in `main`, making the path easier to test and reuse.
- **Admission Failure Deduplication**: Repeated admission failure response logic in `hls_api`, `m3u_api`, and `xtream_api`  
  has been centralized into shared helpers.
- **API User Network Access Restrictions**: API proxy users can now be restricted by source CIDR ranges and/or GeoIP country
  codes via `network_access`.
  - Matching any configured CIDR or any configured country is sufficient for access.
  - Network access checks are centralized in the API user request context so denied requests stop before endpoint handling
    or upstream forwarding.
  - Country-based checks require the GeoIP database. If GeoIP is unavailable, the secure default is to deny requests that
    did not match a configured CIDR.
  - Operators can explicitly opt into allowing this GeoIP-unavailable country-rule case with
    `reverse_proxy.geoip.unavailable_policy: allow`.
  - CIDR-only misses, unknown countries, and country mismatches still deny.
- **QoS Aggregation Efficiency**:
  - QoS snapshot listing does not rely on a full unbounded materialization path for filtered UI/API reads.
  - Current-day QoS rebuilds are skipped when the history day is unchanged.
  - Snapshot traversal APIs were reduced to a single repository traversal style to avoid duplicated code paths.

- **Connection Admission Rules**: Added configurable admission strategies to `reverse_proxy.stream.admission_strategies`
  that control how Tuliprox handles new stream requests when the user or provider connection limit is reached.
  - `evict_user_same_ip_oldest` — evicts the oldest active connection from the same user and IP to make room.
  - `evict_user_same_ip_latest` — evicts the newest active connection from the same user and IP to make room.
  - `evict_user_oldest` — evicts the oldest active connection for the same user, regardless of IP.
  - `evict_user_latest` — evicts the newest active connection for the same user, regardless of IP.
  - `grace_instant_stream` — grants a grace period and immediately starts streaming.
  - `grace_hold_stream` — grants a grace period but holds stream output until the grace check completes.
  - Strategies are evaluated in order; the first matching strategy wins and blocks later ones.
  - Configuration rejects obviously shadowed orderings where `evict_user_oldest` is placed before `evict_user_same_ip_oldest`,
    or `evict_user_latest` before `evict_user_same_ip_latest`.
  - `grace_instant_stream` and `grace_hold_stream` are mutually exclusive.
  - Grace strategies require `grace_period_millis > 0`.
  - Added comprehensive connection handling documentation covering failures, user-visible behavior, priorities, sessions, and reconnects.
  - Added two new runtime-flow handbook pages:
    - operator-facing current runtime flow
    - developer-facing runtime internals and activity flow
- **Session Handling Boundary**: HLS and catchup remain session-based for continuity and provider affinity, but regular TS/VOD/local playback is now
  enforced as socket-bound admission.
  - A second non-HLS socket now counts as a second user connection even for the same user, IP, and stream.
  - This prevents parallel TS/VOD sockets from being collapsed into one logical playback.
  - Soft connections still work normally: once `max_connections` is full, an additional socket may still be admitted as `Soft` when
    `soft_connections > 0`, and provider-side priority/preemption rules still apply afterward.
  - Admission-driven evictions now record the just-evicted session briefly so aggressive player reconnect loops cannot immediately evict the new
    winner back out again.
  - This is not a full user cooldown: reconnects still succeed when a hard slot or soft slot is actually free, and switching to another channel is
    unaffected.
  - For socket-bound TS/VOD/local playback, the anti-ping-pong protection uses a short same-user, same-IP, same-channel winner guard because those
    clients do not provide a stable reconnect session identifier.
  - HLS activity refresh and cleanup dispatch were moved off the request/drop fast path so activity updates do not block segment responses and
    cleanup events are not silently lost when queues are temporarily full.
- **Provider URL Selection Strategy**: Added `provider_url_selection_policy` to provider definitions in `source.yml`.
  - `resume_last_working` (default) — after failover, the provider continues using the last known working URL until it fails again.
  - `restart_from_first` — after failover, the provider always tries from the first URL on the next request.
- **Structured Error Types**: Replaced the old `TuliproxErrorKind`-based error model with a typed `TuliproxError` enum
  using `thiserror`. Each config domain now has its own variant (e.g., `ConfigStream`, `ConfigInput`, `ConfigSource`,
  `ConfigApiProxy`, `ProxyUser`), making error messages precise and traceable.
- **Web UI Landing Page**: Added `landing_page` setting to `web_ui` config to choose the initial view after login.
  Supported values: `dashboard`, `stats`, `streams`, `stream_history`, `downloads`, `users`, `config`,
  `source_editor`, `playlist_update`, `playlist_settings`, `playlist_explorer`, `playlist_epg`, `rbac`.
- **Stream Display Visibility Controls**: Added optional `web_ui.stream_info` config to hide selected fields in the
  active stream display.
  - Supported flags:
    - `hide_group`
    - `hide_ip`
    - `hide_country`
    - `hide_shared`
    - `hide_duration`
    - `hide_bandwidth`
    - `hide_transferred`
    - `hide_player`
    - `hide_user_comment`
    - `hide_epg`
  - If all flags are `false`, the config is treated as absent and the default view remains unchanged.
  - Hidden `epg` also suppresses the per-stream EPG fetch/display work in the dashboard.
- **Runtime Config Report**: Added opt-in startup dump of the complete effective runtime configuration.
  - `log.runtime_config_report_enabled` (default `false`) — enables the report.
  - `log.runtime_config_report_format` — `yaml` (default) or `json`.
  - Sensitive values (passwords, secrets, tokens, API keys) are automatically redacted.
  - Includes prepared `config.yml`, `source.yml`, loaded mappings/templates/api-proxy sections, and resolved paths.
- **CVD-Friendly Theme**: Web UI now includes a CVD (color vision deficiency) friendly theme option.
- **Stream View**:
  - Displays the user comment in the stream view.
  - Displays EPG information in the stream view.

## 🐛 Fixes

- **Template Expansion Efficiency**: Optimized `template.yml` / `template.d` multi-template expansion so sequence-style templates no longer
  duplicate unrelated entries during dependency resolution.
  - Sequence templates still resolve correctly and preserve order.
  - Missing-template and cyclic-dependency validation remains unchanged.
  - This reduces config/Web UI load cost for larger nested template collections.
- **Shutdown Diagnostics**: Stream-history shutdown now reports dead worker situations instead of silently swallowing them.
- **Release Workflow Safety**:
  - `master` releases now refuse to build non-release versions when the patch component is not `0`.
  - The release-version validation now runs before expensive build steps for an early exit.
- **provider:// Scheme**: Fixed `provider://` URL scheme resolution for failover scenarios.
- **Log Level Change**: Fixed runtime log level changes not taking effect.
- **API User Category Selection**: Fixed API user category selection in the Web UI.
- **Refactored Playlist And EPG Explorer**: Playlist Explorer and EPG Explorer have been refactored for improved reliability and UX.
- HLS session info now reports accurate duration and total transferred data.
- Removed open-ssl dependency

## ⚙️ New Settings

- **config.yml (`reverse_proxy.stream`)**:
  - Added `admission_strategies` (optional list): ordered list of admission strategy rules.
    Available strategies: `evict_user_same_ip_oldest`, `evict_user_same_ip_latest`, `evict_user_oldest`, `evict_user_latest`,  
    `grace_instant_stream`, `grace_hold_stream`.
- **api-proxy.yml (`user.credentials[]`)**:
  - Added `output_clusters` (optional list, default effective behavior `all`): restricts a user to `live`, `vod`,
    and/or `series` on the assigned target. If no cluster is selected, the filter is inactive and all clusters are
    served.
- **config.yml (`web_ui`)**:
  - Added `landing_page` (optional, default `dashboard`): initial view after login.
  - Added optional `stream_info` block to hide specific fields in the active stream display:
    - `hide_group`
    - `hide_ip`
    - `hide_country`
    - `hide_shared`
    - `hide_duration`
    - `hide_bandwidth`
    - `hide_transferred`
    - `hide_player`
    - `hide_user_comment`
    - `hide_epg`
- **config.yml (`log`)**:
  - Added `runtime_config_report_enabled` (bool, default `false`): enables full runtime config dump at startup.
  - Added `runtime_config_report_format` (`yaml` | `json`, default `yaml`): output format for the runtime config report.
- **source.yml (`providers`)**:
  - Added `provider_url_selection_policy` (`resume_last_working` | `restart_from_first`, default `resume_last_working`):
    controls URL selection behavior after provider failover.

- **config.yml (`reverse_proxy`)**:
  - Added `qos_aggregation` (optional) with:
    - `enabled` (`bool`)
    - `interval_secs` (`u64`)
- **config.yml (`reverse_proxy.geoip`)**:
  - Added `unavailable_policy` (`deny` | `allow`, default `deny`).
  - `deny` keeps country-based `network_access` restrictions closed when GeoIP is disabled, missing, or not loaded.
  - `allow` is an explicit risk acceptance that allows country-based `network_access` restrictions only when GeoIP is
    unavailable. CIDR-only misses, unknown countries, and country mismatches still deny.
- **api-proxy.yml (`user.credentials[].network_access`)**:
  - Added optional per-user network restrictions:
    - `allowed_networks`: CIDR ranges such as `192.168.0.0/16` or `10.0.0.1/32`.
    - `allowed_countries`: ISO-style country codes resolved through GeoIP.
  - The rules use OR semantics: any matching CIDR or country allows the request.

## 3.3.0 (2026-04-02)

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes 3.3.0

- `working_dir` in `config.yml` renamed to `storage_dir`.
- **Global Input Definitions**: To align input definitions with the SourceEditor, inputs are now defined globally in the `inputs` section of the
  config file. Each source can reference one or more inputs by their name in the `inputs` attribute.
- **Data Format Migration**: Due to heavy refactoring, the old data format is invalid. You need to clean your `data` folder and update the playlists.
- **B+Tree Storage Format**: Storage format has changed to a more efficient Slotted Page architecture.
  - **Index optimization**: Added index to B+Tree to accelerate queries without tree traversal.
  - **TargetIdMapping Optimization**: Refactored to use disk-based B+Tree operations, eliminating startup latency.
  - **B+Tree Header Metadata**: Implemented efficient `BPlusTreeMetadata` Enum to persist `VirtualId` counter directly in the database header.
  - **Fast Initialization**: `TargetIdMapping` now conditionally loads the tree, achieving near-instant startup for established databases.
- **Configuration Renames**:
  - `threads` attribute in `config.yml` renamed to `process_parallel` (boolean).
  - Added mandatory `rewrite_secret` to `reverse_proxy` config for stable resource URLs.
  - Removed `forced_retry_interval_secs`.
  - FFprobe settings moved from `video.*` to `metadata_update.ffprobe.*`.
  - `metadata_update.ffprobe.analyze_duration` and `metadata_update.ffprobe.live_analyze_duration` now require explicit unit suffixes (`s|m|h|d`).
  - **`library.metadata.path` moved to `metadata_update.cache_path`** (default `metadata`).
    The TMDB cache is now shared across all metadata resolution paths (Xtream VOD/Series and local library).
    Remove `path` from `library.metadata` in your `config.yml` and set it under `metadata_update` instead:

    ```yaml
    # Before
    library:
      metadata:
        path: /data/library_metadata
        fallback_to_filename: true
    ```

    ```yaml
    # After
    metadata_update:
      cache_path: /data/library_metadata  # moved here

    library:
      metadata:
        fallback_to_filename: true
    ```
  
- **Input Batch URL Scheme**: Batch input URLs now use the `batch://` scheme instead of `file://`.
  `file://` is no longer accepted for batch CSV definitions. Update your `source.yml`:

    ```yaml
    # Before
    inputs:
      - type: xtream_batch
        url: 'file:///home/tuliprox/config/batch.csv'
    ```

    ```yaml
    # After
    inputs:
      - type: xtream_batch
        url: 'batch:///home/tuliprox/config/batch.csv'
    ```

  Local paths without a scheme (`/path/file.csv`, `./file.csv`) continue to work.
  The `batch://` scheme clearly distinguishes batch alias files from provider `file://` URLs.
- **DNS Resolved Persistence**: `dns.resolved` has been removed from `source.yml` and the `ProviderDnsDto`.
  Resolved IPs are now persisted separately in `{storage_dir}/provider_dns_resolved.json`.
  This eliminates hot-reload interference caused by DNS refresh cycles writing to `source.yml`.
  DNS caches are automatically carried over during config hot-reloads.
- **Input Batch Changes**: `name` attribute is now mandatory for input type batch to ensure stable playlist UUIDs.
- **Favorites Redesign**: Replaced implicit `create_alias` with explicit `add_favourite(group_name)` script function.
  - **EpgSmartMatch**: Field `name_prefix` syntax needs to be changed from  `name_prefix: !suffix "."` to `name_prefix: { suffix: "." }`.
  - **Sort**: Sort can now use filter to sort specific entries.

    ```yaml
    
      sort:
        match_as_ascii: true
        rules:
          - target: group
            field: group
            filter: Input ~ "provider_1"
            order: asc
          - target: channel
            field: caption
            filter: Group ~ "!US_TNT_ENTERTAIN!"
            order: asc
            sequence:
              - "!CHAN_SEQ!"
              - '(?i)\bHD\b'
              - '(?i)\bSD\b'
      ```

  - Trakt api config field `key` is now `api_key`. Added `user_agent` field to Trakt api config
  - resolve_vod_delay and resolve_series_delay are now merged as resolve_delay, added `probe_live` and `probe_live_interval_hours` for live stream
    probing.

      ```yaml

       # Before (deprecated)
       output:
       - type: xtream
         resolve_vod: true
         resolve_vod_delay: 500
         resolve_series: true
         resolve_series_delay: 2
      ```

      ```yaml

       # After (new consolidated)
       output:
       - type: xtream
         resolve_vod: true
         resolve_series: true
         resolve_delay: 2  # Single delay for all resolution types
       ```

## 🌟 New Features 3.3.0

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Replaced the binary admin/non-admin model with fine-grained, group-based permissions.
  - **14 permissions** across 7 domains (`config`, `source`, `user`, `playlist`, `library`, `system`, `epg`),
    each with independent `.read` and `.write` grants.
  - **Group management** via `groups.txt` — define custom roles (e.g., `viewer`, `source_manager`)
    with specific permission sets.
  - **Extended `user.txt` format** — users can now be assigned to one or more groups
    (`username:hash:group1,group2`). Missing group field defaults to `admin` for backward compatibility.
  - **Compact JWT encoding** — permissions are resolved at login and stored as a `u16` bitmask in JWT claims.
    Backend middleware checks permissions via single-instruction bitwise tests.
  - **Password-version tracking** — `pwd_version` in JWT enables automatic token invalidation when a user's password changes.
  - **Backend permission middleware** — per-route `require_permission()` guards replace the old blanket admin check. The backend is the security boundary.
  - **RBAC management API** — CRUD endpoints for web UI users and groups (`/api/v1/rbac/users`, `/api/v1/rbac/groups`, `/api/v1/rbac/permissions`).
  - **Frontend permission gating** — UI elements (buttons, menu items, views) are cosmetically hidden based on the user's resolved permissions.
  - **RBAC admin panel** — new Web UI page with tabbed user/group management, permission checkbox grid, and write-without-read warnings.
  - **No-access page** — users with zero permissions see a friendly "no access" screen instead of an empty dashboard.
  - **Built-in `admin` group** — reserved, always grants all permissions (`*`), cannot be deleted or modified.
- **User Connection Priority**: API users now carry a `priority` field (type `i8`, nice-style: lower value = higher priority, default `0`, probe `127`).
  When all provider slots are occupied and a higher-priority user connects, the lowest-priority active connection on that provider is
  evicted (oldest first when tied). Only connections with exactly one active listener are eligible for eviction; shared connections
  with multiple listeners are not interrupted. Equal priority never evicts equal priority — the new connection is rejected normally
  (with grace-period rules applied as before). User `max_connections` limits are unaffected.
- **Configurable Probe Priority**: Stream-probe tasks (`probe_live`, `probe_vod`, `probe_series`) now run with a configurable priority
  instead of a fixed internal constant. Set `metadata_update.probe.user_priority` (default `127`, i.e. lowest priority) to control how
  aggressively active users can preempt probe connections.
- **User DB Schema Migration V3**: The `api_user.db` file is automatically upgraded to V3 format (adds `priority` field) on first startup.
  A `.userdb_mergeto_v3` guard file is created so config-driven user merges are skipped while the DB is the authoritative source.
- **Background Metadata Queue**: Metadata resolution (VOD/Series) and stream analysis are now queued per input and processed in the background when
  provider connections are idle. This prevents "No Connections" errors for active users during playlist updates.
- **Stream Probing**: Added support for probing streams (`probe_live|vod|series`) to determine codecs and resolution. This runs as a low-priority
  background task.
- **Discord Notifications**: Support for Discord notifications via webhooks with optional Handlebars templates.
- **Enhanced REST Messaging**: Support for custom HTTP methods, headers, and Handlebars templating.
- **Local Library Module**: Comprehensive local video file scanning and metadata management.
  - Recursive scanning, automatic classification, and NFO/TMDB metadata resolution.
  - Incremental scanning and virtual ID management.
- **Panel API Integration**: Optional integration to renew expired input accounts or provision new accounts to ensure a minimum valid input accounts.
- **Playlist Caching**: Added `cache_duration` to inputs, allowing configurable provider playlist cache times during subsequent updates (e.g., `60s`,
  `5m` `12h`, `1d`).
- **Staged Cluster Source Routing**: Added per-cluster staged routing for Xtream inputs.
  You can now decide cluster-wise whether `live` / `vod` / `series` is loaded from staged input, main input, or skipped.
  Skip flags (`xtream_skip_live|vod|series`) remain highest priority and always force skip.
- **Database Viewer**: New CLI flags `--dbx` and `--dbm` to inspect internal database content.
- **Home Directory Override**: Added `--home` (`-H`) CLI argument to set the base directory for config, data, backup, and downloads.
- **Added `disk_based_processing`**: (boolean, default `false`) to `config.yml`. When enabled, input playlists are processed from disk instead of
  memory.
- **User-Agent `default_user_agent`**: Ensures that outgoing requests always pass a default user agent.
- **FFprobe Integration**: Added capability to probe streams for codec, resolution, HDR (HDR10/HLG/DV), and audio channels using `ffprobe`. Probing
  strictly respects provider connection limits. If no slot is available (considering user limits), the item is skipped to prevent provider bans.
- **Metadata Fallback**: Automatically fetches missing TMDB IDs and release dates via the TMDB API if the provider data is incomplete.
- **Streaming**: Added `grace_period_hold_stream` configuration option to delay stream output until grace period connection checks are completed.
- **Provider Failover & Rotation**: Tuliprox supports robust failover mechanisms for streaming providers.
  You can use the special `provider://<provider_name>/...` URL scheme in your configurations. Tuliprox will automatically resolve this to the current
active URL of the specified provider.
  If the current URL fails (e.g., 5xx error, timeout), Tuliprox automatically rotates to the next available URL for that provider.
  It tracks failures and prevents infinite loops by limiting attempts to the number of available URLs.
- Added `epg_request_timeshift: [-+]hh:mm or TimeZone`, example `Europe/Paris`, `America/New_York`, `-2:30`(-2h30m), `+0:15` (15m), `2` (2h), `:30`
  (30m), `:3` (3m)
- **Extended scheduler** to support `Local Library` scans. Scheduler can now trigger automatic library scans alongside playlist updates.
- **Centralized Pattern Templates**: Added a global template collection that is loaded from `config.yml -> template_path` (file or directory) and shared
  across sources and mappings.
- **Template Backward Compatibility**: Existing inline templates in `source.yml` and `mapping.yml` are still loaded and merged during read/validation.
- **Template-Aware Hot Reload**: File watcher now tracks template files/directories and reapplies sources/mappings when templates change.
- **Setup Validation Improvement**: Setup mode validates source configuration against the global template collection and persists template definitions
  separately.
- Added `-T, --template` to override `template_path` on startup.
- **Metadata Update Runtime Config**: Metadata worker intervals, retry/backoff limits, queue sizing, and probe cooldowns are now configurable through
  a dedicated `metadata_update` config block.
- **Unified Metadata Retry State**: Replaced probe-only retry persistence with a single `metadata_retry_state.db` per input. A single record per
  item now stores retry/cooldown state for `resolve`, `probe`, and `tmdb`.
- **TMDB No-Match Cooldown**: Added explicit TMDB cooldown handling. When TMDB resolve completes successfully but returns no match, TMDB reasons are
  suppressed for that item during cooldown to prevent endless requeue loops.
- **HLS/Catchup Provider Reservations**: Added short-lived provider-account reservations for HLS and catchup playback so follow-up requests can stay
  on the same provider account without holding a real provider slot open between requests. New config fields:
  `reverse_proxy.stream.hls_session_ttl_secs` (default `15`) and `reverse_proxy.stream.catchup_session_ttl_secs` (default `45`).
- **Channel Switch Friendly Reservations**: HLS/catchup reservations can now be taken over immediately by a new stream from the same client identity,
  so channel switching does not have to wait for the reservation TTL to expire.
- **Custom Stream Response Timeout**: Added support to limit how long custom fallback stream responses are served.
  Set `config.custom_stream_response_timeout_secs` to a value `> 0` to auto-stop these streams after N seconds. If unset or `0`, custom responses
  are streamed without timeout.
- Added `reverse_proxy.stream.metrics_enabled` to enable per-stream bandwidth and transferred-bytes metrics in the Web UI streams view.

## 🐛 Fixes 3.3.0

- **Resolve Task Cooldown Persistence**: Resolve retry exhaustion is now persisted and consulted before enqueueing, so unresolved VOD/Series entries
  are no longer recreated on every playlist refresh only to be skipped later in the worker.
- **Probe Handle Capacity Leak**: Fixed provider-slot leaks when internal probe tasks timed out, were dropped, or were preempted. Capacity is now
  released reliably even when the underlying probe task does not complete normally.
- **Immediate Probe Preemption**: Higher-priority stream requests now cancel lower-priority probe tasks immediately instead of leaving a grace window
  where the probe could continue holding upstream resources.
- **Anonymous Socket Cleanup**: Tracked anonymous incoming sockets are now pruned automatically after a TTL so stale UI/API keepalive registrations do
  not remain visible forever in active-socket statistics.

## ⚙️ New Settings 3.3.0

- **config.yml (`web_ui.auth`)**:
  - Added `groupfile` (optional, default: `groups.txt` in same directory as `userfile`): path to the RBAC group definitions file.
- **`user.txt`** (extended format, backward compatible):
  - Format is now `username:argon2_hash[:group1,group2,...]`. The optional third field assigns group memberships.
    Missing third field defaults to the `admin` group for full backward compatibility.
- **`groups.txt`** (new file):
  - Defines permission groups in `group_name:permission1,permission2,...` format.
    The `admin` group is built-in and cannot be defined here. See the configuration docs for the full permission list.
- **api-proxy.yml / Web UI (user)**:
  - Added `priority` (`i8`, default `0`) to user credentials. Lower value = higher priority (nice-style).
    Configurable via Web UI user editor. Negative values are valid and represent higher-than-default priority.
- **config.yml**:
  - Added `custom_stream_response_timeout_secs` (`u32`, default `0`): maximum duration in seconds for custom stream response videos.
    `0` disables the timeout and keeps existing behavior.
  - Added `metadata_update.probe.user_priority` (`i8`, default `127`): priority assigned to probe connections.
    Probe tasks run at the lowest priority by default; reduce this value to give probes more connection access.
  - Added `metadata_update` (optional) with grouped sections: `log`, `resolve`, `probe`, `ffprobe`, `tmdb`.
  - Added `metadata_update.cache_path` (default `metadata`): shared storage directory for TMDB cache and metadata files
    (moved from `library.metadata.path`).
  - Added `metadata_update.no_change_cache_ttl_secs` (default `3600`): TTL in seconds for the no-change
    deduplication cache used by background metadata resolve tasks.
  - Added `metadata_update.tmdb.cooldown` (default `7d`) for successful TMDB no-match cooldown behavior.
  - Added `metadata_update.ffprobe.enabled` (default: false), `metadata_update.ffprobe.timeout`, and ffprobe probe/analyze size settings.
  - `metadata_update.ffprobe.analyze_duration` and `metadata_update.ffprobe.live_analyze_duration` require explicit unit suffixes (`s|m|h|d`).
  - FFprobe settings are configured under `metadata_update.ffprobe` (not under `video`).
  - Added `metadata_update.probe_fairness_resolve_burst` (default `200`) to control fairness between resolve and probe tasks.
    After N consecutive resolve-domain tasks, one pending probe-domain task is prioritized to avoid probe starvation.
  - Added `reverse_proxy.stream.hls_session_ttl_secs` (`u64`, default `15`): keeps a short-lived provider-account reservation for HLS sessions.
  - Added `reverse_proxy.stream.catchup_session_ttl_secs` (`u64`, default `45`): keeps a short-lived provider-account reservation for catchup
    sessions and seek/reconnect flows.
  - Added `template_path` (optional): path to a template file (`template.yml`) or directory (`template.d` style).
- **source.yml (input options)**:
  - Added `resolve_tmdb`: Triggers TMDB lookup if ID is missing.
  - Added `probe_stream`: Triggers ffprobe if technical info is missing.
  - Added `probe_delay`: Delay between probe tasks (default `50` seconds).
  - Added `staged.enabled`: Disables/enables the staged input.
  - Added `staged.live_source`: Selects source for Live cluster (`staged` | `input` | `skip`).
  - Added `staged.vod_source`: Selects source for VOD cluster (`staged` | `input` | `skip`).
  - Added `staged.series_source`: Selects source for Series cluster (`staged` | `input` | `skip`).
  - Added staged validation rules:
    - Cluster source rules apply only when `staged.enabled=true`.
    - For Xtream main inputs with staged enabled, at least one cluster source must be `staged`.
    - For staged type `m3u`, `vod_source=staged` and `series_source=staged` are rejected.
- **source.yml (target output)**:
  - Added `probe_live`: Enables background probing for Live TV streams (default disabled).
  - Added `probe_live_interval_hours`: Sets the frequency for re-probing Live TV streams.
  - Added `resolve_background`: Toggles background metadata resolution (default `true`). Set to `false` for blocking, immediate resolution.

## 🛠 Optimizations 3.3.0

- **Quality Tagging**: Generates enhanced filename tags (e.g., `[2160p 4K HEVC HDR TrueHD 7.1]`) for STRM files based on analysis results.
- **Flat Grouping**: When `flat: true` option for STRM output is active, multiple versions (e.g., 4K and 1080p) of the same movie are now safely
  merged over all categories into a single folder based on TMDB ID, compatible with Jellyfin/Emby "Multi-Version" features.

- **Playlist Explorer Resources**: Channel logos (and non-local episode images) are loaded via authenticated same-origin resource endpoints so HTTP
  upstream assets still render behind HTTPS frontends.
- **Local Library Episode Backgrounds**: Local series episode `movie_image` values are now kept as direct TMDB image URLs in series info documents and
  rendered directly in Playlist Explorer.

## 🚀 Performance & Stability 3.3.0

- Fixed file locks to avoid race conditions on file operations

## 3.1.8 (2025-11-06)

- Fixed HLS streaming issues caused by session eviction and incorrect headers.
- Catchup stream fix cycling through multiple providers on play.
- Custom streams fix and update webui stream info
- Added TimeZone to `epg_timeshift: [-+]hh:mm or TimeZone`, example `Europe/Paris`, `America/New_York`, `-2:30`(-2h30m), `+0:15` (15m), `2` (2h),
  `:30` (30m), `:3` (3m)
  If you use TimeZone the timeshift will change on Summer/Winter time if its applied in the TZ.
- Fixed: Mappings now automatically reload and reapply after configuration changes, preventing stale settings.
- Search in Playlist Explorer now returns groups instead of matching flat channel list.
- Added `use_memory_cache` attribute to target definition to hold playlist in memory to reduce disc access.
  Placing playlist into memory causes more RAM usage but reduces disk access.
- Added optional `filter` attribute to Output (except HDHomerun-Output).
  Output filters are applied after all transformations have been performed, therefore, all filter contents must refer to the final state of the
playlist.

- Added burst buffer to shared stream
- Telegram message thread support. thread id can now be appended to chat-id like `chat-id:thread-id`.
- Telegram supports markdown generation for structured json messages. simply set `markdown: true` in telegram config.
- Added User-Stream-Connections Table to WebUI
- Enhanced STRM output filenames to include detailed media quality info (e.g., 4K, HDR, x265, 5.1) for easy version distinction.
- Added standardized SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) and the Proprietary HDHomeRun UDP Discovery Protocol (Port 65001)
- Fixed some session handling issue
- added `reverse_proxy.disabled_header` configuration
  Allows removing selected headers before forwarding requests when acting as a reverse proxy. Configure removal of the referer header, all `X-*`
headers, and additional custom headers.

- !BREAKING_CHANGE! `disble_referer_header` is now part of `reverse_proxy.disabled_header` configuration
- UserTable: Copy credentials to clipboard from user table
- UserTable: Kick user action from streams table
- UserTable: Auto-generated username/password for new proxy users
- Update process uses now streams for data processing.

## 3.1.7 (2025-10-10)

- Added Dark/Bright theme switch
- Resource proxy retries failed requests up to three times and respects the `Retry-After` header (falls back to 100 ms wait)
  to reduce transient HTTP errors (400, 408, 425, 429, 5xx)
- Added `accept_insecure_ssl_certificates` option in `config.yml` (for serving images over HTTPS without a valid SSL certificate)
- VOD streams now use tmdbid from `get_vod_streams` if available, removing the need for `resolve_vod` in STRM generation
- Fixed file length issue in STRM generation
- Fixed empty parentheses issue in series names
- Removed default sorting
- WebSocket now reconnects on disconnect; added WebSocket connection status icon in Web UI
- Added Playlist EPG view with timeline, channels, `now` line, and program details

## 3.1.4 (2025-06-17)

- share live stream refactored
- fixed active user count
- fixed hls streaming
- more logs sanitized
- added session key for session management
- added sleep timer  `sleep_timer_mins`  to config.yml
- added mapper script builtin function `template` to access template definitions.

```text

   station_prefix = template(concat("US_", station, "_PREFIX")),

```

If we assume the variable `station` contains the value `WINK`,
this script receives the template with the concatenated name `US_WINK_PREFIX` which should be defined in `templates` section,
and assigns it to the variable `station_prefix`.

- Extended STRM export functionality with:
  - Support for various media tools (Kodi, Plex, Emby, Jellyfin), with consideration for recommended naming conventions and file organization.
  - Optional flat directory structure via 'flat' parameter (nested folder structures are not supported by some media scanners).
- Added Trakt support for XC targets

```yaml
      - name: iptv-trakt-example
        output:
          - type: xtream
            skip_live_direct_source: true
            skip_video_direct_source: true
            skip_series_direct_source: true
            resolve_series: false
            resolve_vod: false
            trakt:
              api:
                key: <my private trakt api key>
                version: 2
              lists:
                - user: "linaspurinis"
                  list_slug: "top-watched-movies-of-the-week"
                  category_name: "📈 Top Weekly Movies"
                  content_type: "vod"
                  fuzzy_match_threshold: 80
                - user: "garycrawfordgc"
                  list_slug: "latest-tv-shows"
                  category_name: "📺 Latest TV Shows"
                  content_type: "series"
                  fuzzy_match_threshold: 80
```

## 3.1.3 (2025-06-06)

- Fixed xtream codes series info duplicate fields problem.
- Fixed series info container_extension problem.

  station = @Caption ~ "(ABC)"
  match {
     station => {
        # if block
        # station exists
     }
     # optional any match as else block
     _ => {
         # else block
         # station does not exists
     }
  }

```

- New BuiltIn Mapper function `first`. When you use Regular expressions it could be that your match contains multiple results.
  The builtin function `first` returns the first match.

## 3.1.2 (2025-06-02)

- fixed input filter
- fixed epg fuzzy match `match_threshold` default value
- fixed `auto` epg source

## 3.1.1 (2025-05-27)

- fixed m3u api hls handling
- during grace period no data is sent to client.
- splitted config file handling for accurate error messages

## 3.1.0 (2025-05-26)

- !BREAKING_CHANGE! mapper refactored, mapping can be written as a script with a custom DSL.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! `tags` definition removed from new mapper.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! removed `suffix` and `prefix` from input config. Use mapper with an input filter instead.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! custom_stream_response is now `custom_stream_response_path`. The filename identifies the file inside the path
  - user_account_expired.ts
  - provider_connections_exhausted.ts
  - user_connections_exhausted.ts
  - channel_unavailable.ts
    `user_account_expired.ts`: Tuliprox will return a 403 Forbidden response for any playlist request if the user is expired.
    So this screen will only ever appear if someone tries to directly access a stream URL after their account has expired.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! epg refactored
  - url config is now renamed to sources
  - Added `priority`, priority is `optional`
  - `auto_epg` is now removed, use `url: auto` instead.
  - Added `logo_override` to overwrite logo from epg.

**Note:** The `priority` value determines the importance or order of processing. Lower numbers mean higher priority. That is:
A `priority` of `0` is higher than `1`. **Negative numbers** are allowed and represent even higher priority

```yaml
epg:
  sources:
    - url: "auto"
      priority: -2
      logo_override: true
    - url: "http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=1"
      priority: -1
    - url: "http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=2"
      priority: 3
    - url: "http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=3"
      priority: 0
  smart_match:
    enabled: true
    fuzzy_matching: true
    match_threshold: 80
    best_match_threshold: 99
    name_prefix: !suffix "."
    name_prefix_separator: [':', '|', '-']
    strip :  ["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]
    normalize_regex: '[^a-zA-Z0-9\-]'
```

- Fixed mapper transform capitalize.
- Auto hot reload for `mapping.yml`and `api-proxy.yml`
  To enable set `config_hot_reload: true` in `config.yml`
- Added config.d-style mapping support.
  You can now place multiple mapping files inside a directory like `mapping.d` and specify it using the `-m` option, for example:
  `-m /home/tuliprox/config/mapping.d`
  The files are loaded in **alphanumeric** order.
  **Note:** This is a lexicographic sort — so `m_10.yml` comes before `m_2.yml` unless you name files carefully (e.g., `m_01.yml`, `m_02.yml`, ...,
`m_10.yml`).

- Added `mapping_path` to `config.yml`.
- Added list template for sequences. List templates can only be used for sequences.

```yaml
templates:
  - name: CHAN_SEQ
    value:
      - '(?i)\bUHD\b'
      - '(?i)\bFHD\b'
```

The template can now be used for sequence

```yaml
  sort:
    groups:
      order: asc
    channels:
      - field: caption
        group_pattern: "!US_TNT_ENTERTAIN!"
        order: asc
        sequence:
          - "!CHAN_SEQ!"
          - '(?i)\bHD\b'
          - '(?i)\bSD\b'
```

- added `disable_referer_header` to `reverse_proxy` config
  This option, when set to `true`, prevents tuliprox from sending the Referer header in requests made when acting as a reverse proxy. This can be
particularly useful when dealing with certain Xtream Codes providers that might restrict or behave differently based on the Referer header. Default is
`false`.

```yaml

reverse_proxy:
  disable_referer_header: false
```

## 3.0.0 (2025-05-12)

- !BREAKING_CHANGE! user has now the attribute `ui_enabled` to disable/enable web_ui for user.
  You need to migrate the user db if you have used `use_user_db:true`.
  Set it to `false` run old tuliprox version, then update tuliprox and set `use_user_db:true`and start.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! all docker images have now tuliprox under `/app`
- !BREAKING CHANGE! bandwidth `throttle_kbps` attribute for `reverse_proxy.stream` in  `config.yml`
  is now `throttle` and supports units. Allowed units are `KB/s`,`MB/s`,`KiB/s`,`MiB/s`,`kbps`,`mbps`,`Mibps`.
  Default unit is `kbps`.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE!  `log` config `active_clients` renamed to `log_active_user`
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! `web_ui config` restructured and added `user_ui_enabled` attribute

```yaml

web_ui:
  enabled: true
  user_ui_enabled: true
  path:
  auth:
    enabled: true
    issuer: tuliprox
    secret: ef9ab256a8c0abe5de92c2e05ca92baa810472ab702ff1674e9248308ceeec92
    userfile: user.txt

```

- `grace_period_millis` default set to 300 milliseconds.
- `grace_period_timeout_secs` default set to 2 seconds.
- Fixed user grace period
- Added `default_grace_period_timeout_secs` to `reverse_proxy.stream` config. When grace_period granted,
  until the `default_grace_period_timeout_secs` elapses no grace_period is granted again.
- Added `method` attribute to input config. It can be set to `GET` or `POST`.
- Added optional `auto_epg` field to `input epg config` for auto-generating provider epg link.
- Added rate limiting per IP. The burst_size defines the initial number of available connections,
  while period_millis specifies the interval at which one connection is replenished.
  If behind a proxy `x-forwarded-for`, `x-real-ip` or `forwarded` should be set as header.
  The configuration below allows up to 10 connections initially and then replenishes 1 connection every 500 milliseconds.

```yaml

reverse_proxy:
  rate_limit:
    enabled: true
    period_millis: 500
    burst_size: 10

```

- Multi epg processing/optimization, auto guessing/assigning epg id's
- Fixed hls redirect url issue
- Added `force_redirect` to target config options. valid options are `live`, `vod`, `series`

```yaml

 options: {ignore_logo: false, share_live_streams: false, force_redirect: [vod, series]}

```

```yaml

epg:
  url: ['http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=1', 'http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=2']
  smart_match:
    enabled: true
    fuzzy_matching: true
    match_threshold: 80
    best_match_threshold: 99
    name_prefix: !suffix "."
    name_prefix_separator: [':', '|', '-']
    strip :  ["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]
    normalize_regex: '[^a-zA-Z0-9\-]'

```

`match_threshold`is optional and if not set 80.
`best_match_threshold` is optional and if not set 99.
`name_prefix` can be `ignore`, `suffix`, `prefix`. For `suffix` and `prefix` you need to define a concat string.
`strip :  ["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]`  this is the defualt
`normalize_regex: [^a-zA-Z0-9\-]`   is the default

```yaml

# single epg

url: 'https://localhost.com/epg.xml'

```

```yaml

# multi local file  epg

url: ['file:///${env:TULIPROX_HOME}/epg.xml', 'file:///${env:TULIPROX_HOME}/epg2.xml']

```

```yaml

# multi url  epg

url: ['http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=1', 'http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=2']

```

- Added `strip` to input for auto epg matching, if not given `["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]` is default
  When no matching epg_id is found, the display name is used to match a channel name. The given strings are stripped to get a better match.
- Fixed chno assignment issue
- Redirect Proxy provider cycle implemented (m3u playlist only cycles when output param `mask_redirect_url` is set).
- Reverse Proxy mode for user can now be a subset
  - `reverse`           -> all reverse
  - `reverse[live]`     -> only live reverse, vod and series redirect
  - `reverse[live,vod]` -> series redirect, others reverse
- `/status` api endpoint moved to  `/api/v1/status` for auth protection
- fixed multi provider VOD seek problem (provider cycle on seek request prevented playback)
- hdhomerun supports now basic auth like <http://user:password@ip:port/lineup.json>
  you need to enable auth in config

```yaml

hdhomerun:
  enabled: true
  auth: true
  devices:
    - name: hdhr1

```

- A new filter field `caption` has been added. This field is used to bypass the `title/name` issue.
  If `caption` is provided, its value is read from `title` if available, otherwise from `name`.
  When setting `caption`, both `title` and `name` are updated.”
- Counter has now an attribute `padding`. Which fills the number like 001.
- Added proxy configuration for all outgoing requests in `config.yml`. supported http, https, socks5 proxies.

```yaml

proxy:
  url: socks5://192.168.1.6:8123
  username: uname  # <- optional basic auth
  password: secret # <- optional basic auth

```

- Added support for regular expression-based sequence sorting.
  You can now sort both groups and channels using custom regex sequences.

```yaml
sort:
  groups:
  order: asc
  sequence:
    - '^Freetv'
    - '^Shopping'
    - '^Entertainment'
    - '^Sunrise'
  channels:
    - field: caption
      group_pattern: '^Freetv'
      order: asc
      sequence:
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bUHD\b'
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bFHD\b'
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bHD\b'
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bSD\b'
```

In the example above, groups are sorted based on the specified sequence.
Channels within the `Freetv` group are first sorted by `quality` (as matched by the regex sequence), and then by the `captured prefix`.

To sort by specific parts of the content, use named capture groups such as `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, etc.
The numeric suffix indicates the priority: `c1` is evaluated first, followed by `c2`, and so on.

- Added ip check config
  - url # URL that may return both IPv4 and IPv6 in one response
  - url_ipv4 # Dedicated URL to fetch only IPv4
  - url_ipv6 # Dedicated URL to fetch only IPv6
  - pattern_ipv4 # Optional regex pattern to extract IPv4
  - pattern_ipv6 # Optional regex pattern to extract IPv6

```yaml

ipcheck:
  url_ipv4: https://ipinfo.io/ip

```

## 2.2.5 (2025-03-27)

- fixed web ui playlist regexp search
- added `web_ui_path` to `config.yml`
- added grace period `grace_period_millis`  attribute for `reverse_proxy.stream` in  `config.yml`
  If you have a provider or a user where the max_connection attribute is greater than 0,
  a grace period can be given during the switchover.
  If this period is set too short, it may result in access being denied in some cases.
  The default is 1000 milliseconds (1sec).
- added bandwidth `throttle_kbps` attribute for `reverse_proxy.stream` in  `config.yml`

| Resolution      |Framerate| Bitrate (kbps) | Quality     |
|-----------------|---------|----------------|-------------|
|480p (854x480)   |  30 fps | 819–2.457      | Low-Quality |
|720p (1280x720)  |  30 fps | 2.457–5.737    | HD-Streams  |
|1080p (1920x1080)|  30 fps | 5.737–12.288   | Full-HD     |
|4K (3840x2160)   |  30 fps | 20.480–49.152  | Ultra-HD    |

## 2.2.4 (2025-03-24)

- fixed `connect_timeout_secs:0` prevents connection initiation issue.
- fixed `hdhomerun` and `strm` config check for non-existing username.
- "Breaking CHANGE! Moved `connect_timeout_secs` is global timeout and defiend in config root and not `reverse_proxy.stream`.

## 2.2.3 (2025-03-23)

- variable resolving for config files now for all settings
- hls reverse proxy implemented
- dash redirect implemented (reverse proxy not supported)
- !BREAKING CHANGE! `channel_unavailable_file` is now under `custom_stream_response`,
- New custom streams `user_connections_exhausted` and `provider_connections_exhausted`added.

```yaml

custom_stream_response:
  channel_unavailable: /home/tuliprox/resources/channel_unavailable.ts
  user_connections_exhausted: /home/tuliprox/resources/user_connections_exhausted.ts
  provider_connections_exhausted: /home/tuliprox/resources/provider_connections_exhausted.ts

```

- input alias definition for same provider with same content but different credentials

```yaml
- sources:
  - inputs:
    - type: xtream
      name: my_provider
      url: 'http://provider.net'
      username: xyz
      password: secret1
      aliases:
        - name: my_provider_2
          url: 'http://provider.net'
          username: abcd
          password: secret2
    targets:
      - name: test
```

Input aliases can be defined as batches in csv files with `;` separator.
There are 2 batch input types  `xtream_batch` and `m3u_batch`.
`XtreamBatch`:

```yaml
- sources:
  - inputs:
    - type: xtream_batch
      url: 'file:///home/tuliprox/config/my_provider_batch.csv'
    targets:
      - name: test
```

```csv

#name;username;password;url;max_connections;priority
my_provider_1;user1;password1;http://my_provider_1.com:80;1;0
my_provider_2;user2;password2;http://my_provider_2.com:8080;1;0

```

`M3uBatch`:

```yaml
- sources:
  - inputs:
    - type: m3u_batch
      url: 'file:///home/tuliprox/config/my_provider_batch.csv'
    targets:
    - name: test
```

```csv

#url;max_connections;priority
http://my_provider_1.com:80/get_php?username=user1&password=password1;1;0
http://my_provider_2.com:8080/get_php?username=user2&password=password2;1;0

```

The Fields `max_connections` and `priority`are optional.
`max_connections`  will be set default to `1`. This is different from yaml config where the default is `0=unlimited`

- added two options to reverse proxy config `forced_retry_interval_secs` and `connect_timeout_secs`
  `forced_retry_interval_secs` forces every x seconds a reconnect to the provider,
  `connect_timeout_secs` tries only x seconds for connection, if not successfully starts a retry.

## 2.2.2 (2025-03-12)

- !BREAKING CHANGE! Target options moved to specific target output definitions.

target `options`:

- `ignore_logo`: `true`|`false`,

target output type `hdhomerun`:

- `device`: _mandatory_,
- `username`: _mandatory_,
- `use_output`: _optional_, `m3u`|`xtream`

Example:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: xc_m3u
    output:
      - type: xtream
        skip_live_direct_source: true,
        skip_video_direct_source: true,
      - type: m3u
      - type: strm
        directory: /tmp/kodi
      - type: hdhomerun
        username: hdhruser

- Added `user_config_dir` to `config.yml`. It is the storage path for user configurations (f.e. bouquets).
- New Filter field `input` can be used along `name`, `group`, `title`, `url` and `type`. Input is a `regexp` filter. `input ~ "provider\-\d+"`
- New option `use_user_db` in `api-proxy.yml`. The Playlist Users are stored inside the config file `api-proxy.yml`. When you set this option to
  `true`
  the user are stored in a db file. This is a better choice if you have a lot of users. If you have only a few let it default to `false`

  `strm` files now o get timestamp from `addedd`property if exists.
- shared live stream implementation refactored.
- added optional user properties: `max_connections`, `status`, `exp_date` (expiration date as unix seconds).
  If they exist they are checked when `config.yml` `user_access_control` set to true., if you don't need them remove this fields from `api-proxy.yml`
  Added option in `config.yml` the option `user_access_control` to activate the checks. Default is false.
- Added option `channel_unavailable_file` in `config.yml`. If a provider stream is not available this file content is send instead.
